GitHub is a website built on top of Git, it’s a bit like Google Drive, it’s a cloud storage
platform where organisations and individuals can host their code. GitHub adds a couple
extra features to Git such as forks, pull requests, and code reviews.


## Forks

Forks are copies of repositories hosted on GitHub that have a relation to the upstream
repository. This connection is important later on as we’ll want to open pull requests from
our downstream repository to the upstream repository.

## Pull requests and code reviews

Pull requests are developers requesting to merge in some of their code changes from
their downstream repository into the upstream repository. Since GitHub is all about
collaborating with other developers, it will show what we call a diff which tells other
developers what code was changed, and allows other developers to discuss those code
changes.
