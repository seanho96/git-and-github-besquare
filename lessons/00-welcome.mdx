    Hello ðŸ‘‹ I'm Sean Ho and welcome to intro to Git and Github session!<br/> 
    A little fun fact about me is that I've lived across 2 different continents and 
    4 cities throughout my time.

Over the next two weeks weâ€™re going to be working on a bunch of different
projects, some of which are team-based, so we need to figure out a way on how to work
together efficiently, and the answer to this is by using Git and GitHub. Git is the worldâ€™s
most popular system for sharing code between developers.


## Outline
Things we will be covering today:

* Git
* Github
* Forks
* Pull requests and code reviews
* Set up Git and Github
* Registering a Github account
* Setting up your identity
* Getting a copy of the BeSquare Git repository
* Putting Git into practice
* Branches
* Adding a file to Git
