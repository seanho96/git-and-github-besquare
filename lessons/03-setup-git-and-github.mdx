## How to set up Git and GitHub

### Registering a GitHub account

Let’s get started with setting up Git and GitHub. Let’s first set up a GitHub account (if
you haven’t done so already) through https://github.com/join.

- **Tip**: Make a note of the email address you used to sign up to GitHub, as we’ll
need to use this later on.

After you’re finished signing up to GitHub, let’s set up Git. Git lives inside a terminal of
your device (there are GUI versions available but you’re a developer now, let’s get used
to the terminal).

<br />

Git should be preinstalled on the machine that we gave you. If not, please run the command 
below in your terminal.

```bash
sudo apt install git
```

Now all that we have to do is connect Git to GitHub. We do this by setting the Git identity 
and we can do so using the following commands in your terminal:


```bash
git config --global user.name "Firstname Lastname"
git config --global user.email your@email.com
```
<br />

### Setting up your identity

Besides setting up our identity in Git we also have to make a connection between
GitHub and Git so that GitHub knows you’re not an impostor. We’ll do this by setting up
SSH authentication.

**To generate a new SSH key:**

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C 'your_email'
```

**Add it to ssh-agent**
This starts the agent in background

```bash
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
```
```bash
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```
- **Note**: if you changed default name, replace `id_rsa` with your PK file

<br />

Now that we generated and added the SSH key, let’s copy the public key to our GitHub account. Visit
the following page: https://github.com/settings/ssh/new
- For title you can type anything, e.g. “Dell Deriv”
- In the key input, paste the generated SSH key

- **Note**: For more info on adding new ssh keys to github, you can check out this 
[documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account)

For displaying the public key to be copied, you can run

```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```
<br />

After doing so, please use the command below to verify the key was added
successfully:

```bash
ssh -T git@github.com
```

It should return a message similar as below:
