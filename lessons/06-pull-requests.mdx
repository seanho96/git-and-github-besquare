## Making a pull request

Our changes currently only live in the repositories (our local one and our cloud one) that we can manage, but we want to merge 
in our changes to a repository managed by Deriv. At Deriv we can’t just allow anyone to merge in their changes (that would be 
a security hole), but for our frontend we allow anyone in the world to open pull requests which can be reviewed by the team.

- Let’s visit the main repository’s pull requests URL, which is: https://github.com/seanho96/git-and-github-intro/pulls

- Once we’re on that page, click on the green `New pull request` button.

- This will open a new page, find the text in blue saying `compare across forks` and click it.

- Now select the correct branch to merge into the upstream repository’s master branch.

Once you’re ready to create the pull request, click “Create pull request” and write a short title and description for your changes. 
Then click “Create pull request” again, and that’s it. Your changes are now going to be reviewed by the frontend team 
(and maybe some robots too).
