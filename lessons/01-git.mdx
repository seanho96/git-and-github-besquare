title: What is Git?

## Git
Git is useful as it allows you to keep track of changes made to your repository and if
necessary it can help you revert back to a previous version of your repository (for the
sake of this section it’s safe to assume a repository is a project folder containing all
source files). In addition, you can see who deleted or moved files around, or you can
see who wrote that impossible-to-understand code. At Deriv we have about 30 frontend
developers and a lot of times we’re touching the same files, without Git this would
quickly become a mess.

Git is a distributed version control system, which means that each developer working
with the code has the entire history on their device, allowing them to work locally without
interfering with other developers. Once a developer wants to synchronise the changes
with others, they will have to merge their code, and one way of doing this is by opening
a pull request on GitHub (more on that later) to merge in the changes with the upstream
repository.
