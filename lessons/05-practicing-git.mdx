title: Practicing Git
---

Now that we have the repository on our local machine, let’s start using Git by adding our GitHub username to the project repository, 
we’ll use everyone’s username later to automatically divide everyone into teams.

## Branches

Branching in Git allows us to diverge from the main branch (which is usually the master branch, github now defaults to main) 
and make modifications without messing with the main branch. At Deriv we use the feature branch workflow, which means that we 
create a new branch for each new “feature” that we’re adding. Later on when we want to merge our changes with the main branch, 
we can use the `git merge` command to do so, which will merge both branches together.

### Creating a branch

```bash
git status
```

Should give you a response like `On branch master`.

<br />

As you can see we’re currently on the master branch, which is the main branch of the repository we’re working with. 
Let’s create a new branch so we don’t mess up the main code, use the command below (you can replace `my_branch` with anything):

```bash
git checkout -b my_branch
```

<br />

Now we have two equal versions of the code, one being the master branch and the other being the `my_branch` branch, 
we can start adding new code and files to our project.

<br />

## Adding a file to Git

Let’s go to the project folder and navigate to the students folder. You’ll find a file named README.md with some instructions 
on what changes to make. Let’s open it and see what we should do.

As per the instructions, we should 
- Create a new file inside the students folder and the file should be named your_github_username.txt. 
- The content of the file should be a one-sentence description of yourself, e.g. “Amazing listener. Not so good at talking.” 
(keep in mind that these are visible to everyone in the world).

<br />

### The working tree (area)

After creating the file, go back to the terminal and write:

```bash
git status
```

You will get an output with something a long the lines of

- By creating the username file we’ve instructed Git to move this file to an area we call the **working tree**, which is 1 out of 3 
areas Git has. 
- Let’s try to visualise these (it’s perfectly ok if you don’t get this right away). As we said above, we have 3 areas. The **working tree**, 
the **staging area**, and the **repository**. 
- When we’re adding or editing a file to our project folder it will be reflected in the **working tree**. The **working tree** contains 
all the files that have been added, modified, or deleted, but haven’t been **staged** yet. We can stage files by using the `git add` command.

<br />

### The staging area

Let’s use the `git add` command to add our file to the **staging area**.

```bash
git add people/your_username.txt
```

<br />

Once we’ve executed the above command, the file has been added. In the **staging area** we collect the files that we want to **commit** to the repository. 
We can verify that the file is in our **staging area** by running `git status` again. If it shows in green, you’re good.

<br />

### The repository

Great! The file is ready to be committed to our repository, and we can do that by using the git commit command. We should provide a message explaining 
what the commit is all about too and we can do so as per the example below:

```bash
git commit -m "Introduce a little about myself"
```

<br />

Your name file is now part of the repository. Now all that’s left to do is to create a pull request to the upstream repository so we can divide you guys into teams.

<br />

## "Pushing" your changes to GitHub

We’ve added a file to our local repository, but as we saw earlier in this course, there are actually 3 repositories we’re working with. The upstream repository, 
a forked repository hosted on GitHub, and our local repository.

![3 repositories](/3-repos.png)

We’ve pushed our username file to the repository marked in blue. Let’s push the changes we made to our GitHub fork in the cloud so our changes are safe. 
We can do so using the git push command.

```bash
git push --set-upstream origin my_branch
```

Our changes are now pushed to GitHub and we can now create a pull request.
