title: Forks
---

Over the next few weeks we’ll be working on individual projects, but also on team based
projects. The repository we will be working with in this part of the course will help us
create those teams and also assign mentors to each team. In this chapter, we’ll learn
how to fork a repository on GitHub.

Forking a repository means that you’re making an exact copy (or clone) of another
repository, while also creating a connection between your repository and the upstream
repository. It’s a GitHub feature that allows us to create pull requests later on which are
heavily used when collaborating with multiple developers.

**Note:** forking and cloning is different. Forking means that you’re making an exact copy of original 
repository while cloning the repository is copying it to your local machine.

## Getting a copy of the BeSquare Git repository

The repository we’re forking is this one https://github.com/seanho96/git-and-github-intro/.
Visit that page and find the **Fork** button. This will copy the repository to your own
GitHub account and create a relation to the upstream repository.

After forking the repo on GitHub you’ll have your own version of the repo on GitHub, it’ll
be hosted on something like `https://github.com/<your_username>/git-and-github-intro-git`

Let’s download a copy of your repository to your local machine. We can do so by
copying the SSH address of your repository given to us by GitHub:

<br />

Copy the URL from the dialog and run the command below:

```bash
git clone <copied_url>
```

<br />

You now have a copy of your forked repo on your local device. Below is a visualisation
of the 3 repositories we currently have.
